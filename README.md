### Hi there, I'm Adithya 👋

- 🔭 I’m getting familiar with data mining and scripting
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DSA and eventually plan to learn AWS architecture and design
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning your experiences in software engineering 
- 💬 Ask me about the MVP for a data viz platform I developed in MERN and my chatbot mimicMe
- 📫 How to reach me: contactadithyab@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm very new to the game, but I'll probably level up faster
- 🕹️Outside work: You'll probably find me gaming for hours or watch science stuff like F1
- Currently working on: 1brc repo, mimicMe Public repo.
